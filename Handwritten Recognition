# DL: Built and Trained a CNN for MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition
The goal of this project was to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contained 70,000 grayscale images of digits (0-9), each 28x28 pixels in size. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the project created and trained a deep learning model to classify these digits accurately. It involved data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation to understand CNNs and their application.

# Tasks Completed:
* Loaded the MNIST dataset correctly.
* Normalized the pixel values between 0 and 1.
* Built a CNN with convolutional layers.
* Included MaxPooling layers.
* Added dense layers and the correct output layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation.
* Used the 'adam' optimizer.
* Set the loss function to 'categorical_crossentropy'.
* Tracked accuracy as the evaluation metric.
* Trained the model.
* Tracked both training and validation accuracy/loss.
* Evaluated the model on test data.
* Plotted accuracy and loss graphs.
